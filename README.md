## Project Topic
Experiments on Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing  

## Abstract
We first devise two problems on parameter estimation. We perform experiments for different sample size and observe the varied value of estimates.  
We also devise two problems on hypothesis testing. We perform experiments for different sample size and different true values and observe the variation in Type I error and Type II error.
